## A Brief Intro

I'm a beginner to both Vue3 and Typescript. When learning Vue3, I found there are not many resourses about how to build a entire vue3+typescript project.
So I built this project to practise what I learned from vue3 and typescript.
Considering I'm just a beginner, there are definitely many mistakes in this project.

But I think mistakes make a person progress, so any advice like "you can do better here"/"you shouldn't do so there" are welcomed.
Also, if you have some interesting features wishing me to write a demo, you can tell me too.
All of these above can be told me via issues.

## Todo List

- [x] A simple vue3+ts template project
- [x] A simple 3D model with three.js
- [x] A simple plugin of i18n
- [x] A basic vue-route
- [x] Some simple animation
- [x] A simple chat room([Rust](https://github.com/bellemere/ws-chat-rust) as backend)
- [ ] Vue3 + GSAP
